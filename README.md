# Bambu Studio Filament Library
Library for storing 3rd Party Filament settings for Bambu Labs and other Printers using the Bambu Studio

Key contribution and inspiration for this was from user AI_RPI_SPY on Redit, the post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BambuLab/comments/16j5189/filament_profiles_importing_both_filament_and/

## What EXACTLY is this:

## How do I use it?
Within the file are setting files for all of eSun's filaments, which can be copied into the printers configuration folder. There are 3 file types filament / process/ printer.

The bambu studio config settings location is :

Mac: /Users/(your username)/Library/Application Support/BambuStudio/User

Windows :C:\Users\XXXX\AppData\Roaming\BambuStudio\user

Inside the user folder are two folder one Default the other is the ID of your printer.

Choose your printer and navigate to the filament folder and copy the filament files to the filament folder and the process files to the process folder.

You can check if this has worked by adding a new filament name and the filaments you just added should be listed under User Presets.
